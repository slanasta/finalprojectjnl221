        <h2>College Students and Online Sports Betting</h2>
        <p class="lead"> <b> State legalization of online sportsbooks is making it easier than ever for college students to participate - but at what cost? </b> </p>
        
      
      <div class="article-body">
        <p>By Sophia Anastasakis</p>  
        <p> This week marks five months of legal online sports betting in the state of New York, which is currently deemed the online sports betting capital of the country. Since the decision in January, the state made over $425 million from mobile sports betting and leads the rest of the country in revenue generated from online sports wagers. </p>

          <p> New York is one of 20 states that legalized online sports betting, and several other states like Maryland and Washington are likely to expand their regulations in the coming months. Under the new gambling laws, adults 21 and over are allowed to place sports bets online without having to be in a casino. </p>
          
          <iframe title="Sports Betting Legalization in the US" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-TeWOu" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TeWOu/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="487"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
                   </script>
          
          
          <p> There are currently nine online sportsbooks options available for bettors in New York, which include companies DraftKings, FanDuel, and Caesars Entertainment. With the tap of a screen, anyone can link their credit or debit card to one of the sportsbooks and place bets, opening the door for older college students to get involved. </p>
          
          <p> "We’ll see a lot more people getting into gaming, whether that’s a good thing or bad thing," says John Wolohan, Professor of Sports Law at Syracuse University. </p>
          
          <p> "You don’t call your local bookie, now all I have to do is pick up my phone, get to my app and say ‘This is who I’m betting on.’ The problem of course is bookies will take your bets without your money. Whereas casinos, you need to put the money up before you can make the bets." </p>
          
          <iframe title="Mobile Sports Wagering Handles" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-DDOC3" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/DDOC3/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="550"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

          <p> Over 80% of all online sports bettors are men, according to the Fantasy Sports and Gaming Association. Another survey by Civic Science found that online sports bettors ages 21 to 29 make up 53% of the market - more than any other age group. So it’s no surprise that college campuses with large sports scenes are seeing higher engagement with these online sportsbooks. </p>
          
          <p> Some universities, like Louisiana State University and the University of Colorado at Boulder, developed multi-year partnerships with these companies, providing them with naming rights for stadium sections in exchange for loyalty programs for students and internship opportunities. </p>
          
          <p> Syracuse University has a partnership with Turning Stone, a local casino, and said they plan to evaluate the partnership as the sports betting market evolves, according to an article by Syracuse.com in 2018. Wolohan says a partnership between the university and a sportsbook could be more lucrative. </p>
          
          <p> “There are some schools," said John Wolohan, a professor of sports law at Syracuse University, "that will say we need the extra money. There are some schools that will say it's just not worth it. We don't want to go down that way." </p>
          
          <p> Online sports betting is different from fantasy sports or traditional betting in that bettors can make moneyline, point spread, over/under, live, and parlay bets. This means a person can bet on who they think will win, a point margin, the next play, and multiple specific game outcomes. </p>  
          
          <p> Of course, all bets are not created equal. Parlay bets are notorious for their high risk, high reward as the odds of winning are slim yet the payout is much greater. </p>
          
          <p> Braden Reed, a sophomore broadcast journalism student at Syracuse University, is the executive producer of the Citrus TV show “Beat the Bookie,” where student hosts make their picks to beat the sportsbooks for the week's biggest games. </p>
          
          <p> Reed, who sees sportsbook ads on a regular basis, expressed concerns about the way online sportsbooks are pushing parlay bets. </p>
          
          <p> “I don't think people really realize that this is the way that these sportsbooks are making money. They offer you all this money to get in 100 hours worth of free bets, but then you're putting that towards something that has little to no chance of hitting,” said Reed. “By that point, you're hooked.” </p>
          
          <p> DraftKings and FanDuel lead in ad spending with a combined total of over $155 million last year, with a majority going to TV and the rest divided among digital, radio and out of home, according to Ad Age. </p>
          
          <p> Despite the potential dangers for problem gambling, Reed says that online sports betting adds another fun layer to sports and makes seemingly less important games more enjoyable to watch. </p>
          
          <p> “You're on the edge of your seat more and it's just as enjoyable as a playoff game.” </p>
          
          <p> While he can’t legally bet himself, Reed says knows a good amount of SU students who place bets online, and for most of the time, do so responsibly. However, he noticed some people who can’t watch a game without checking bets.</p>
          
          <p> “If that's all you're thinking about, like ‘I need this team at this player to score X amount of points or my night is going to be ruined,’ that's no fun,” Reed said. “As soon as you start to get more involved with the betting side of it than the actual game, that's when it can be a little dicey.” </p>
          
          <p>Most recent research estimates that 6% of college students in the U.S. have a serious gambling problem compared to the 1% of all U.S. adults who have a gambling problem, according to the International Center for Responsible Gambling. Studies also showed that male college students are more likely to have gambled, gambled with more money, and reported gambling as a problem. </p>
          
          <Additionally, a recent study by OneClass found that college students spend an average of six to seven hours a day on their phone, almost nearly twice as much as the national adult average of less than four hours. Increased screen time creates more opportunities for marketers to target students. </p>
          
          <p> As the issue develops, Wolohan says regulations are bound to change, especially those regarding the way sportsbooks market to a younger demographic. </p>
